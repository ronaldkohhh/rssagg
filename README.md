# RSS Aggregator

We're building an RSS feed aggregator in Go! It's a web server that allows clients to:

- Add RSS feeds to be collected
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow
- RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!



Learning goals:
- Learn how to integrate a Go server with PostgreSQL
- Learn about the basics of database migrations
- Learn about long-running service workers
